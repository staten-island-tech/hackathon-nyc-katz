- This is Detective Pussycat
- Right now I am in front of a recently murdered cat's house. This murder occurred in upper east Cat City.
- Her name was Catricia Calligan, and she owned a flower shop in mid Cat City. She was an active member of the Cathatten country club.
- We are about to enter her house, where the crime has been reported by her neighbor, Catfinny Catsmith.

- Let's go investigate the body.
*Walks up to body
- From the looks of it, it seems as if she died from a slit throat. Minimal damage everywhere else.

- Oh a gun! Hmm, it's registered under Catricia Calligan, perhaps she used it to defend herself?
- Let's look around the room a bit more.
*walks to drawer in living room
